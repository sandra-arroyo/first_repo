```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

This is just a test of my first attempts using GitHub

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```


```{r, test-plot}
plot(cars, col = "red", xlab = "speed (mph)", ylab = "distance (miles)")
```

A summary of the data frame is given below

```{r, cars-summary}
library(knitr)
kable(summary(cars))
```
